# Refactor Tractor - Turing Mod 2 Group Project

Our team was tasked with refactoring a project completed by another group using 3 new technologies: jQuery, SCSS, and the fetch API. The app itself is a meal planning app that fetches user, recipe, and ingredient data from an API and displays it in a one page application titled "Fresh Picks." A user has the ability to browse recipes, read ingredient/instructions for each, favorite recipes, add ingredients to their "pantry," and make meals (removing ingredients from the user's pantry).

The project was a great exercise in navigating foreign codebases, organizing and implementing new technologies, and collaborating using Trello and code reviews within pull requests.
